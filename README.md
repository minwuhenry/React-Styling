# React-Styling
Rendering in React: Styling
# Instructions
Add inline styling to the App component so that the following is true:

All three lines are centered.

"Hello!" uses the cursive font family.

"How are you?" uses the monospace font family.

In the src folder, add an external stylesheet called App.css. Require this CSS file at the top of App.js.

Using App.css, style "Today is a nice day!" any way you like (e.g., change the font size or color). Use a className value of App-weather-message on the element.
